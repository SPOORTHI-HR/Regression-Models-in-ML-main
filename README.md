🧠 Regression Models in Machine Learning
This repository focuses on implementing and comparing various regression models on housing data to predict house prices. The notebook leverages preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a range of regression models to draw meaningful insights from the dataset.

📁 Repository Contents
